# Frontend API Reference

Backend base URL (production): set in your `.env` as `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.  
All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`.  
Swagger UI (dev only): `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

## Auth

Every protected endpoint requires:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token comes from the login response. Store it in `sessionStorage` (key: `accessToken`) and send it with every request.

---

### POST `/api/v1/auth/login`

```json
// Request
{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secret" }

// Response 200
{
  "token": "<jwt>",
  "profile": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "appraisal_role": "faculty",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "school": "SoCSEA — School of Computer Science, Engineering & Applications",
    "employee_id": "EMP001",
    "designation": "Assistant Professor",
    "qualification": "M.Tech",
    "teaching_experience": "5 years",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "avatar": null
  }
}
```

Error 401 — wrong credentials.  
Error 403 — account not yet verified.

---

### POST `/api/v1/auth/register`

```json
// Request
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secret",
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "appraisal_role": "faculty",
  "school": "SoCSEA — School of Computer Science, Engineering & Applications",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "designation": "Assistant Professor",
  "employee_id": "EMP001",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "qualification": "M.Tech",
  "teaching_experience": "5 years",
  "academic_year": "2025-2026"
}

// Response 200
{ "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account.", "email": "user@example.com" }
```

Newly registered users cannot log in until they click the verification link sent to their email. `is_verified` starts as `false`.

---

### GET `/api/v1/auth/verify-email?token=<token>`

Called automatically when the user clicks the link in their verification email. Redirects to `<FRONTEND_URL>/login?verified=true` on success.

---

### GET `/api/v1/auth/me` — requires auth

Returns the same profile object shape as the login response.

---

### PUT `/api/v1/auth/me` — requires auth

```json
// Request (all fields optional)
{
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "designation": "Professor",
  "qualification": "PhD",
  "teaching_experience": "8 years",
  "employee_id": "EMP001",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "school": "SoCSEA — School of Computer Science, Engineering & Applications"
}

// Response: updated profile object (same shape as login profile)
```

---

### POST `/api/v1/auth/change-password` — requires auth

```json
// Request
{ "current_password": "old", "new_password": "new" }

// Response 200
{ "message": "Password changed successfully" }
```

Error 400 — incorrect current password.

---

### POST `/api/v1/auth/forgot-password`

Generates a one-time reset token, stores its hash in `password_reset_tokens`, and emails the raw token to the user.  
Always returns 200 regardless of whether the email exists (prevents email enumeration).

```json
// Request
{ "email": "user@example.com" }

// Response 200
{ "message": "If that email is registered, a reset link has been sent." }
```

---

### POST `/api/v1/auth/reset-password`

Verifies the token hash in `password_reset_tokens` (must be unused and not expired), then updates `password_hash` in `faculty_profiles` and marks the token as used.

```json
// Request
{ "token": "<raw_token_from_email>", "new_password": "newSecret123" }

// Response 200
{ "message": "Password reset successfully." }
```

Error 400 — token is invalid, already used, or expired.

---

## Appraisal Form (teaching staff)

---

### GET `/api/v1/appraisal/snapshot?academic_year=2025-2026` — requires auth

Returns the faculty's saved draft/submitted form payload, or `null` if none exists yet.

```json
// Response 200
{
  "faculty_email": "faculty@example.com",
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "payload": {
    "form": {
      /* full form sections — see Submit for shape */
    },
    "totals": { "partATotal": 45.5, "partBTotal": 30.0, "grandTotal": 75.5 },
    "docs": {
      /* doc key → array of uploaded file objects */
    },
    "submitterProfile": {
      /* profile at time of save */
    },
    "savedAt": "2025-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

---

### PUT `/api/v1/appraisal/snapshot` — requires auth

Save a draft. Called on auto-save. Safe to call many times — upserts on `(faculty_email, academic_year)`.

```json
// Request
{
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "payload": {
    "form": { /* full form sections */ },
    "totals": { "partATotal": 45.5, "partBTotal": 30.0, "grandTotal": 75.5 },
    "docs": { /* doc key → array of uploaded file objects */ },
    "submitterProfile": { /* profile object from sessionStorage */ },
    "savedAt": "2025-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}

// Response 200
{ "message": "Snapshot saved" }
```

---

### POST `/api/v1/appraisal/submit` — requires auth

Final submission. Shreds the form into all normalized DB tables (e.g. `teaching_process`, `journal_publications`, etc.), creates/updates the `declarations` row, and saves docs to `appraisal_documents`.  
If the admin has closed submissions for this year, returns **403** with `user_message`.

The frontend first tries with the workflow fields included. If the backend returns 400 or 422 (older backend that does not support them), it retries without the workflow fields.

```json
// Request — primary (with workflow fields)
{
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "form": {
    "lectures":          [ { "semester": "Odd", "course_code": "CS101", "planned_classes": 40, "conducted_classes": 40 } ],

  "workflow_status": "Pending HOD Review",
  "next_reviewer": "hod",
  "next_reviewer_role": "hod",

}

// Response 200
{ "message": "Submitted successfully", "submitted_at": "2025-06-01T10:00:00" }
```

**Note on `review_chain`:** computed from school/role — backend may use this to set the initial workflow status or validate it. If the faculty's school has no HOD (most schools except SoEMR), the chain starts at `director`. CISR faculty go `center_head → vc` directly.

---

### GET `/api/v1/appraisal/status?academic_year=2025-2026` — requires auth

Returns the declaration row and all reviews received so far for the logged-in faculty.  
Called by every dashboard (faculty, HOD, director, dean) to show the faculty's own appraisal progress.

```json
// Response 200
{
  "declaration": {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "faculty_email": "faculty@example.com",
    "academic_year": "2025-2026",
    "part_a_total": 45.5,
    "part_b_total": 30.0,
    "grand_total": 75.5,
    "status": "Pending HOD Review",
    "submitted_at": "2025-06-01T10:00:00"
  },
  "reviews": [
    {
      "reviewer_role": "hod",
      "reviewer_email": "hod@example.com",
      "part_a_score": 42.0,
      "part_b_score": 28.0,
      "total_score": 70.0,
      "section_scores": { "lectures": 45, "journals": 80 },
      "remarks": "Good performance",
      "status": "Pending Director Review",
      "reviewed_at": "2025-06-05T14:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns `{ "declaration": null, "reviews": [] }` if the faculty has not submitted yet.

---

## Dashboard (reviewer roles)

Reviewers: `hod`, `center_head`, `director`, `dean`, `vc`.  
`faculty` and non-teaching roles receive an empty array.

---

### GET `/api/v1/dashboard/subordinates` — requires auth

Returns all faculty visible to the logged-in reviewer for the given year, enriched with their self-scores and any reviewer scores already submitted.

| `pending_status`      | Yes      | Status string the reviewer is looking for, e.g. `"Pending HOD Review"`            |
| `reviewer_school`     | No       | School of the reviewer (used to filter results)                                   |
| `reviewer_department` | No       | Department of the reviewer (used by HOD to scope to own dept)                     |

```json
// Response — array of:
{
  "email": "faculty@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "school": "SoCSEA — School of Computer Science, Engineering & Applications",
  "appraisal_role": "faculty",
  "designation": "Assistant Professor",
  "status": "Pending HOD Review",
  "submitted_at": "2025-06-01T10:00:00",
  "part_a_total": 45.5,
  "part_b_total": 30.0,
  "grand_total": 75.5,
  "hod_total": 42.0,
  "hod_part_a": 40.0,

  "dean_remarks": "",
  "vc_total": 0,
  "vc_part_a": 0,
  "vc_part_b": 0,
  "vc_remarks": ""
}
```

Reviewer totals are `0` / empty string until that reviewer has submitted their review.

---

### GET `/api/v1/dashboard/faculty/{email}?academic_year=2025-2026` — requires auth

Returns the full saved snapshot (same shape as `GET /appraisal/snapshot` payload) for a specific faculty member.  
The logged-in user must have authority over that faculty member — otherwise **403**.  
Used by reviewer dashboards to open and read a faculty's submitted form.

---

## Review submission (reviewer roles)

All five review endpoints share the same request/response shape.

The frontend first sends the request **with** the workflow-forwarding fields. If the backend returns 400 or 422 (older version), it retries with **only** the base fields (`academic_year`, `remarks`, `part_a_score`, `part_b_score`, `total_score`, `section_scores`).

```json
// Request body — full (preferred)
{
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "remarks": "Good overall performance.",
  "part_a_score": 42.0,
  "part_b_score": 28.0,
  "total_score": 70.0,
  "section_scores": {
    "lectures": 45.0,
    "courseFile": 16.0,
    "journals": 80.0
  },
  "status": "Pending Director Review",
  "workflow_status": "Pending Director Review",
  "review_status": "HOD Reviewed",
  "next_reviewer": "director",
  "next_reviewer_role": "director"
}

// Response 200
{ "message": "Review submitted", "status": "Pending Director Review" }
```

**`{email}` path param** is the faculty member being reviewed (URL-encoded).

| Endpoint                                            | Reviewer role | Notes                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUT /api/v1/appraisal-remarks/hod/{email}`         | `hod`         | Standard schools with HOD (SoEMR departments only)      |
| `PUT /api/v1/appraisal-remarks/center-head/{email}` | `center_head` | CISR faculty only; next reviewer is `vc`                |
| `PUT /api/v1/appraisal-remarks/director/{email}`    | `director`    | All schools — is first reviewer for schools without HOD |
| `PUT /api/v1/appraisal-remarks/dean/{email}`        | `dean`        | Engineering or non-engineering division dean            |
| `PUT /api/v1/appraisal-remarks/final/{email}`       | `vc`          | Final review; sets status to `Reviewed`                 |

**`next_reviewer` / `status` values by role:**

| Reviewer      | `review_status`        | `status` / `workflow_status` | `next_reviewer` |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| `hod`         | `HOD Reviewed`         | `Pending Director Review`    | `director`      |
| `center_head` | `Center Head Reviewed` | `Pending VC Review`          | `vc`            |
| `director`    | `Director Reviewed`    | `Pending Dean Review`        | `dean`          |
| `dean`        | `Dean Reviewed`        | `Pending VC Review`          | `vc`            |

## Non-teaching staff appraisal

Non-teaching staff (`appraisal_role = "non_teaching_staff"`) use a separate form with two parts:  
**Part A** — self-assessment (3 items, max 25 marks total)  
**Part B** — authority ratings across 4 sections (max 105 marks total, rated by RO / Registrar / VC only)

The entire form is stored as a JSONB `payload` column in `non_teaching_appraisals`.

---

### GET `/api/v1/non-teaching/appraisal?academic_year=2025-2026` — requires auth

### PUT `/api/v1/non-teaching/review/{staffEmail}` — requires auth

Submit a review for a non-teaching staff member. `{staffEmail}` is URL-encoded.  
The reviewer fills in their marks in the `payload` (Part A marks as `roMarks`/`regMarks`/`vcMarks`; Part B ratings as `p{n}_ro`/`p{n}_reg`/`p{n}_vc`), and the updated payload is sent back.

```json
// Request
{
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "payload": {
    /* full form payload with reviewer's marks filled in */
  },
  "status": "Reporting Officer Reviewed",
  "remarks": "Satisfactory performance"
}

// Response 200: updated record (same shape as GET /non-teaching/subordinates item)
```

**`remarks` field mapping inside payload:**

| Reviewer            | Remarks field in payload |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `reporting_officer` | `roRemarks`              |
| `registrar`         | `registrarRemarks`       |
| `vc`                | `vcRemarks`              |

## Documents

### GET `/api/v1/appraisal-documents?academic_year=2025-2026` — requires auth

Returns all uploaded supporting documents for the logged-in faculty for that year.  
Used to restore document links when the faculty re-opens their form.

```json
// Response — array of:
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "faculty_email": "faculty@example.com",
  "academic_year": "2025-2026",
  "section": "journals",
  "doc_key": "journals0",
  "row_no": 1,
  "file_name": "paper.pdf",
  "file_type": "application/pdf",
  "file_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../paper.pdf",
  "storage_path": "faculty/uploads/uuid_paper.pdf",
  "uploaded_at": "2025-05-15T12:00:00"
}
```

---

## File upload

### POST `/api/v1/upload` — requires auth — `multipart/form-data`

Upload a supporting document. Returns a file object to store inside the form's `docs` map.

```
// Form fields:
file   — the binary file
folder — storage sub-folder, e.g. "faculty-appraisal/<doc_key>" or "non-teaching-appraisal/<doc_key>"

// Response 200
{
  "url":      "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../filename.pdf",
  "publicId": "faculty/uploads/<uuid>_filename.pdf",
  "name":     "filename.pdf",
  "type":     "application/pdf"
}
```

Only one file per section slot is kept. If the user uploads again for the same slot, the new file replaces the old one on the frontend before submitting.

---

## Announcements

### GET `/api/v1/announcements` — no auth required

Returns all active announcements to display on the login page and dashboards.

```json
// Response — array of:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Appraisal cycle 2025-2026 is now open",
  "body": "All faculty must submit by 30 June 2025.",
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2025-05-01T09:00:00"
}
```

---

## Error format

Every error response from the backend must follow this shape:

```json
{
  "user_message": "Invalid email or password.",
  "detail": "..."
}
```

**Always show `user_message` in the UI.** The `detail` field is for the network tab / bug reports only.

```js
try {
  const res = await apiClient.post('/api/v1/auth/login', { ... })
} catch (err) {
  const userMessage = err?.response?.data?.user_message || "Something went wrong."
  showToast(userMessage)
}
```

## Appraisal config (admin-only)

The backend controls whether submissions are open or closed via the `appraisal_config` table.  
On `POST /appraisal/submit`, if `is_open = false` for the given `academic_year`, the backend must return:

```json
// 403
{
  "user_message": "Appraisal submissions for 2025-2026 are currently closed.",
  "detail": "appraisal_config.is_open is false"
}
```
